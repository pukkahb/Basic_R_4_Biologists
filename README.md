Welcome to this beginner-friendly R tutorial! This guide is specifically designed for biology students and researchers who are new to R and want to get started with basic data analysis, visualization, and manipulation.

R is a powerful open-source programming language and environment for statistical computing and graphics. It's widely used in biology for everything from analyzing gene expression data to modeling ecological systems.

## üéØ What You Will Learn

* How to set up your R environment.
* Loading and understanding a common biological dataset (Iris dataset).
* Performing basic data exploration (summaries, structure).
* Simple data manipulation (filtering, selecting columns).
* Creating basic visualizations using `ggplot2`.
* Conducting a very simple statistical test.

## üì¶ Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed:

1.  **R:** The base R environment. You can download it from [CRAN (The Comprehensive R Archive Network)](https://cran.r-project.org/).
2.  **RStudio Desktop:** An integrated development environment (IDE) that makes working with R much easier. Download it from [RStudio's website](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/).

## üöÄ Getting Started

Clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone [https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git](https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git)
cd your-repo-name
````

Open the `.R` script files in RStudio to follow along.

### Step 1: Loading and Exploring the Data

We'll start by loading the built-in `iris` dataset, which contains measurements of sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width for 150 iris flowers of three different species (setosa, versicolor, and virginica).

Open `01_data_loading_exploration.R` and run the commands.

-----

### Step 2: Basic Data Manipulation

Once you have your data loaded, you'll often need to manipulate it. This includes selecting specific columns, filtering rows based on certain conditions, or creating new variables.

Open `02_data_manipulation.R` and run the commands.

-----

### Step 3: Data Visualization

Visualizing your data is crucial for understanding patterns, distributions, and relationships. We'll use the `ggplot2` package, which is a very popular and powerful tool for creating high-quality graphics in R.

First, you need to install `ggplot2` if you haven't already:

```r
install.packages("ggplot2")
```

Open `03_data_visualization.R` and run the commands.

-----

### Step 4: Simple Statistical Analysis

R is primarily a statistical language. Let's perform a very basic statistical test to compare the means of two groups. We'll use a t-test to see if there's a significant difference in `Sepal.Length` between 'setosa' and 'versicolor' species.

Open `04_simple_analysis.R` and run the commands.

## ‚û°Ô∏è Next Steps

Congratulations\! You've completed a basic R tutorial for biologists. Here are some ideas for what to explore next:

  * **Explore more `ggplot2` features:** Learn about different plot types (bar plots, violin plots), customizing colors, themes, and combining plots.
  * **Learn about data wrangling with `dplyr`:** A powerful package for data manipulation (filtering, selecting, arranging, summarizing, joining data).
  * **Dive into more statistical tests:** Explore ANOVA, regression, correlation, etc.
  * **Work with your own data:** Try importing your own biological datasets (e.g., `.csv`, `.tsv` files) into R and applying what you've learned.
  * **Learn about functions:** How to write your own reusable code blocks.
